#This is a project challenge created by front end mentor and completed by Naser Abdulkadir.

This is a multipage website built with react.

In this project I learned how to:

1. use react router to link to multiple pages.
2. learn how to make active links with NavLink from react-router-dom.
3. organize code by making a folder for each component and its style sheet.
4. create seperate file for the context and use the useContext hook to bring in data and use it when and where I needed it.
5. learned the basics of tailwind and custom css classes (started to use tailwind but switched to regular css stylesheets).

I will update this readme when im done making smaller changes to get the project ready. Im about 85% done with the project.
